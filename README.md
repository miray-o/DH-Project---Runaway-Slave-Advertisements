# Counter-Coding the Archive: Fugitive Slave Ads

This repository contains my research, trials, and analysis for the project, "Counter-Coding the Archive: Fugitive Slave Ads and the Digital Reclamation of Black Narratives."

# Project Overview

This project intervenes in the racialized erasures of the archive by using computational approaches to analyze fugitive slave data from 18th and 19th-century New York. By bringing a Black studies perspective to digital humanities methods, the project aims to reframe narratives of fugitivity, moving beyond the enslaver's perspective. The goal is not just to quantify records but to use the resulting dataset to support a rich qualitative analysis, reconstructing patterns of collective action, mobility, and social identity among fugitives that the original sources sought to obscure.

# Workflow

## Step 1: Digitizing Newspaper Advertisements

I am working with three types of primary sources:

- Already digitized and transcribed by previous scholars, such as "Pretends To Be Free" by Graham Russell and Alan Edward Brown.

- Digitized photographs of historical documents.

- Non-digitized primary sources to be visited in person.

Sources 2 & 3 need to be transcribed using OCR techniques (e.g., Transcription Pearl). A key part of this step is also documenting where OCR fails (e.g., distorting Black vernacular) as a way of noting the racialized limits of digitization.

## Step 2: Creating The Dataset (With Name Entity Recognition)

- Build a dataset that includes standard metadata (name, age, gender) from the advertisements alongside interpretive tags to reflect the implications of the descriptors used.

## Step 3: Temporal and Linguistic Analysis

- Temporal Visualization: Use time-series charts to map when certain descriptors or traits peaked. This will help correlate the language of the ads with historical events (e.g., Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, urban growth, abolitionist activism).

- Linguistic Clustering (+ Word Embeddings): Analyze co-occurring adjectives, nouns, or verbs to uncover hidden taxonomies of race and gender used by enslavers. This will help identify patterns in how enslaved men versus women were described (e.g., physical traits, skills, behavioral characteristics).

## Step 4: Analysis and Interpretation

Use the findings from Step 3 to answer the project's key research questions:

- How did descriptions of fugitive slaves shift over time and space?

- What can these shifts reveal about the changing fears or concerns of enslavers?

- What patterns exist in the gendered and racialized language of the ads?

- Do these patterns correlate with historical events or legal changes?
