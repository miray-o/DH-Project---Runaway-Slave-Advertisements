*How might computational approaches to fugitive slave data in New York (18th–19th c.) intervene in the racialized erasures of the archive and reframe narratives of fugitivity?*

In today’s world, where big data increasingly defines the way knowledge is constructed, the data produced by digital humanities approaches continues to reflect and reinforce biases rooted in the histories of racism and slavery. The historical records of fugitive slaves overwhelmingly reflect the perspective of white enslavers. These include sheriff reports, newspaper ads, and wanted posters that commodify Black people. When these documents are digitized and datafied without critical reflection, they risk unintentionally perpetuating the racist intentions of their creators. Bringing a Black studies perspective into the field of digital humanities highlights the many ways enslaved people gained their freedom and reclaimed their humanity, in contrast to the narratives imposed by the sources. A Black studies perspective challenges digital humanities scholars to view data collection and analysis not as purely objective exercises, but as opportunities for humanistic interpretation. By coupling quantitative analysis with the sociopolitical interpretive traditions of Black studies, we can reverse dominant narratives and reveal what primary sources intended to obscure or conceal.

The aim of this project is not simply to quantify archival records, but to use the quantitative dataset to support and enrich qualitative analysis. My methodology builds on the work of Crystal Eddins (2020[^1]), who applied statistical tools to examine associations between demographic variables, such as gender, age, linguistic ability, and other forms of social or human capital, in more than one hundred thousand fugitive slave ads published in 18th-century Haitian newspapers. Her findings offered new perspectives on Maroon behavior leading up to the 1791 Haitian Revolution. To date, there is no comparable study that computationally analyzes the behaviors and experiences of fugitive slaves in the New York area during the 18th and 19th centuries. The goal is beyond counting frequencies or generating visualizations, but to reconstruct possible patterns of collective action, mobility, and social identity among fugitives. 

First, I will acquire relevant historical documents and convert them to text using Transcription Pearl, an AI-powered optical character recognition (OCR) application, for the sources without OCR transcription. Furthermore, I will document where OCR fails (e.g., distorting Black vernacular or degrading language) as examples of the racialized limits of digitization technologies. Then, I will build a dataset not just with metadata (name, age, gender), but also with interpretive tags, e.g., “gendered labor role,” “coded intelligence,” “maternal framing,” to reflect both the content and implications of the descriptors used. I will use computational analysis methods such as temporal visualization to use time-series charts to map when certain descriptors or traits peaked, correlating these with historical events (e.g., Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, urban growth, abolitionist activism). Temporal visualization will help to answer key questions: How did descriptions of fugitive slaves shift over time and space? Did the use of certain descriptors (e.g., intelligence, literacy, parenting status, language ability) increase during specific periods or in particular regions? What can these shifts reveal about changing fears or concerns among enslavers? Furthermore, I will analyze co-occurring adjectives, nouns, or verbs to uncover hidden taxonomies of race and the enslavers' use. Linguistic clustering will answer key questions: What patterns can be found in the gendered and racialized language used in reward advertisements? Are there patterns in how enslaved men vs. women were described, such as physical traits, skills, or behavioral characteristics? Are certain stereotypes reproduced more frequently, and do they correlate with historical events or legal changes?

The project will make a significant theoretical contribution to demonstrate that digital tools, when used reflexively and critically, can help illuminate the humanity and resistance of those whom historical records sought to erase. The project does not simply seek to recover lost voices but amplify suppressed knowledge, question the archive's authority, and show how data, when reimagined through Black Studies, can become a form of counter-history.**
