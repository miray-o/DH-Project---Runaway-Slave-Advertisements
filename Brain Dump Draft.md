Since the rise of artificial intelligence, historians, like any other professionals, look for ways in which AI can make their jobs easier/faster/more accurate. The rise of digital humanities started with the integration of Natural Language Processing models and data science with historical analyses to do a distant reading of primary sources, revealing insights that are often missed by historians who can only see a limited part of the sources at a single time. With the recent development of artificial intelligence and large language models, historians look ahead to an even more prospectus era regarding computational support in the research process. Generative AI created a new era within digital humanities, where computational models are less demanding and not limited to doing only distant work. With generative AI, computational models do not need large training datasets with highly specific annotations, which gets rid of a large constraint for historians who often lack enough data to train models (for example, ancient texts where generative AI can predict the missing parts without needing a large number of complete examples from historians).  

With the latest GPT-5 model release, OpenAI claimed that ew GPT-5 is now as intelligent as a PhD holder. This raises a question whether these models can be research assistants to historians. Can they do close reading of primary sources as well as historians, or at least good enough to be a supportive tool? 
In this article, I experimented with various LLM models to test whether these generative AI models can close-read primary sources and uncover what is not explicitly told (read in between the lines), make connections to larger context, and, most importantly, mitigate biases that silenced historically marginalized groups. 

The prominent act of resistance in these notices is the fact that these runaways forced themselves into history by running away with such bravery. As Trouilliot describes, the silences that are born in the making of archives are a discussion of what mattered at that time, and these slaves were able to make their voices heard by making people record their escape.
	One larger trend that showcases slave owners' perpsective towards ressitance is that at that time all these runaway cases were seen and treated as individual people "going mad." Enslaved weren'T seen as powerful and smart to execute a mass organization. 
	Today's historians can reverse this narrative by creatively reinterpreting and reframing the past. The question is whether LLm models can use their advanced pattern-recognition ability to mimic this creativity. 
However there are more than running away that revealed the mass resistance in the enslaved community. Simple mentions of literacy skills, preferred names, hobbies, etc. show how enslvaed inserted their own space into the country. 

This article focuses on runaway slave advertisements from 18th-century New York and New Jersey. There is a large and robust scholarly work on runaway slave advertisements, largely in New England, where historians utilized close reading methods to read between the lines where mass resistance of enslaved populations was apparent. 
- [[‘Indubitable signs’- reading silence as text in New England runaway slave advertisements]] --> Bly argues that runaway slave advertisements were written by enslavers to simply get back their "commodities." Even though they were seen as commodities, the descriptions in the notices "capture powerful tales of African Americans as active actors in history." (Bly, 2021, p. 240)
	- completes an analysis of runaway notices "as the first slave narratives," where African Americans are active actors in history. 
	- According to Bly, enslaved people co-authored those ads: "by running away, slaves compelled their masters to respond." (Bly, 2021, p. 241)
	- Bly proceeds with specific examples from runaway slave notices from New England newspapers, where enslavers used the correct spelling of the enslaved's preferred names which shows enslavers were successful at reclaiming their identity to a certain extent. 
	- However, the limitations are apparent in studying these notices as a slave narrative. They showcase one side of the events and are limited in time frame. They do not provide any information on what was going on in enslaved people's minds or what happened after they ran away or before (if they are) they are caught. 
	- "Despite slave owners’ attempts to deny them their humanity, they communicated a great deal more and in so doing made it impossible for their owners to fully ignore them." (p.258)

More than running away -- free slaves in New York 

- Not all ran away to be free; to be frank, being free was sometimes no better than staying ensalved. However, running away gave them an advantage when they returned, reminding slave owners of the humanity of their slaves. 
"Instead, they created new and clever ways to resist the arbitrary authority of their masters and find autonomy in their personal lives, such as being able to use the legal system to their advantage or developing a skill set that allowed them to work independently." (Hardesty, 2016, p. 4 ) --> learned literacy and mechanical skills, and musical skills like fiddling, to start earning money independently before gaining freedom. 

Mention of their skills in runaway notices not only to ease recognition but also to accept the intelligence and economic importance of enslaved people.
